I am a PhD Candidate at [the Department of Geography of the University of British Columbia](https://geog.ubc.ca/profile/baifei-ren/).  My research centers on urban heat resilience, green gentrification, and climate justice. In particular, I investigate the interconnections among social vulnerability, thermal comfort, and ecosystem services. This work seeks not only to generate empirical insights but also to develop methodological approaches and practical tools that can inform regional planning processes attentive to the principles of climate justice.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Luke Bergmann](https://geog.ubc.ca/profile/luke-bergmann/) of the University of British Columbia.

I graduated with a Master’s degree in Landscape Architecture from [Peking University (PKU)](https://english.pku.edu.cn/about.html), preceded by a Bachelor’s degree in Urban Planning from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/ABOUT/HUST_at_a_Glance.html) in China.
