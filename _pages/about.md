I am a PhD student from [the Department of Geography of the University of British Columbia](https://geog.ubc.ca/profile/baifei-ren/).  I focus my research interests on areas of urban heat resilience and equity of urban public green spaces. I will explore the relationships between vulnerability, urban heating, and green space, offering not only particular empirical results but also methods and tools that will be of use as regions consider climate justice in their planning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Luke Bergmann](https://geog.ubc.ca/profile/luke-bergmann/) of the University of British Columbia.

I graduated with a Master’s degree in Landscape Architecture from [Peking University (PKU)](https://english.pku.edu.cn/about.html), preceded by a Bachelor’s degree in Urban Planning from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/ABOUT/HUST_at_a_Glance.html) in China.
